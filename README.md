# Notes

A note taking mobile app with a Bible Feature to view Bible Chapters and Verses. This is an app I built for my personal use at church because I take lots of notes at church during sermon.

## Features
- Create, read, update and delete notes
- A local Sqflite database which store notes locally within the device
- A bible feature to view Bible chapters and verses as you take your notes.
- Interaction with a [BIBLE API](https://scripture.api.bible/) to display bible books, chapters and verses.
